# Tutorial-Gird-following-Inverter
A comprehensive Python tutorial for simulating grid-following inverters. This project implements Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs) solved via the Implicit Trapezoidal Rule and Newton Raphson method.  There are three different operational support modes: Constant PQ, Frequency support and Volt-Var 

## 📐 System Configuration

### Network Topology
The system consists of a two-bus network:
* **Slack Bus (Grid):** An infinite bus with a fixed voltage magnitude ($V_{slack}$) and angle ($\theta_{slack}$).
* **Inverter Bus:** The point of common coupling (PCC) where the inverter is connected.

### Physical Interface
The inverter is interfaced with the grid through a **series RL filter**. The output voltage of the inverter, $v_g^{abc}$, is dynamically controlled to manage the power flow across the filter's coupling impedance to the second node.

### Control Architecture
The control system is implemented in the $dq$-reference frame and consists of:
1. **Synchronization:** A Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to track the grid frequency and angle.
2. **Outer Power Loop:** Manages Active ($P$) and Reactive ($Q$) power setpoints.
3. **Inner Current Loop:** Fast-acting control of $i_d$ and $i_q$.
